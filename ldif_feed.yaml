# ou starts at the root base domain and can be "tiered"
# e.g. ou=vault,ou=um_group
# um_group is for storing UniqueMember entries.  Because these will automatically be created based on user records
#  they don't have to be explicitly defined
# posix_group is for storing members who log into posix systems
#  gid will be assigned automatically during template rendering
# people is for storing person records
# service_acct is for storing service accounts or other automate users
